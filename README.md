# welcome to my Rock-Paper-Scissor Game.
this is probably the third or fourth project i build. But this one is special because i didn't follow a tutorial to build it.( a lot of googling :) ).
i hope to come back in the future and look at my code and say i grew, even if it's a little. please feel free to drop some comments and tweak it a bit. I know it can probably be better but i hope that i get better in the future. HaVe A gOoD dAy :).
